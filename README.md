# mhc-datathon-2025

## Rubric

While there are many things that go into creating a good report for a company, here are some of the area your team will be tested on:

- Demonstrates a thorough understanding of datasets and effectively selects and integrates relevant data sources.

- Provides clear, detailed insights addressing the business questions, supported by appropriate metrics and visuals.

- Presents recommendations that are directly tied to data findings and the business context.

- Ensures the final project is clearly formatted and logically organized on their GitHub page.

## Guidelines

In order to have a successful datathon experience, each team would need to be mindful of the following:

- Projects must be presented in a GitHub Page.

- Projects must have a 1-2 minute video on their page explaining their projects.

- Projects will go through an initial review, of which only 20 teams will make it through. These 20 teams will be able to present, and the top 3 will win.

- Teams must fill out an intent to submit and a valid submission for their project to be reviewed.

- At least one team member should be in attendance at the kickoff meeting, and if you make it to presentations, at least one person (preferably all the team members) should be presenting.

- Projects will be due on Wednesday, the 24th. Forms to submit will be sent in a separate email.

- All participants must be in Discord. If you do not have the Datathon role, contact Maryam (013msi) in Discord. Add your teammates to the server as well.

## Business Questions To Answer

1. Which MTA bus routes are highly utilized by CUNY students? For routes that are automated camera-enforced, how have bus speeds changed over time?

   - Recommendation - Compare a bus route you or someone you know utilizes for campus. Compare this with another campus route and a route that is not ACE enforced.

2. Some vehicles stopped in violation are exempt from fines due to business reasons. For vehicles that are exempt, are there repeat offenders? Where are exempt vehicles frequently in violation?

   - Recommendation - This problem is great for a mapping visualization! Choose a CUNY bus route that you are familiar with plot the long and latitude of where vehicles are in violation as well as the overall bus route.

3. Some automated camera-enforced routes travel within or cross Manhattanâ€™s Central Business District. How have violations on these routes changed alongside the implementation of congestion pricing?

   - Recommendation - Another great problem to share a mapping visualization. Map CUNY Bus Routes that run through the CBD before and after congestion pricing to show change in bus speeds.
